# Project: ISLA IT Asset Management

## Description
This project is a web-based system for managing the IT assets of ISLA-IPGT. It enables efficient tracking of hardware, software, and educational equipment to streamline inventory management and maintenance.

---

## Features
- **Asset Tracking:** Manage and monitor IT assets, including hardware, software, and didactic equipment.
- **User Management:** Assign roles and permissions for different user levels (Admin, Technician).
- **Maintenance Logging:** Track and attach maintenance actions to any asset type.
- **Image/Document Attachment:** Upload photos or documents for any asset.
- **Reports & Insights:** Generate reports on asset status and utilization.
- **Search & Filtering:** Easily find and filter assets based on various criteria.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Laravel (JWT Authentication)
- **Database:** MariaDB/MySQL
- **Tools:** Insomnia (API testing), Beekeeper/DBeaver (Database management), GitHub (version control)

## 🚦 Step-by-Step Setup & Development Guide

### 1. **Project Preparation**
- [ ] Clone this repository:  
  `git clone https://github.com/DanielFerreira-hub/projeto-integrado.git`
- [ ] Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), and [MariaDB/MySQL](https://mariadb.org/) are installed on your system.

---

### 2. **Database Setup**
- [ ] Open Beekeeper/DBeaver and create a database called `isla_asset_management` (or your preferred name).
- [ ] Note your DB username and password for use in the backend configuration.
- [ ] See `/docs/database_schema.md` for the full schema and ER diagram guidelines.

---

### 3. **Backend (Laravel) Setup**
- [ ] Go to the `backend` folder:  
  `cd backend`
- [ ] Install dependencies:  
  `composer install`
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:  
  `cp .env.example .env`
- [ ] Update `.env` with your DB credentials.
- [ ] Generate application key:  
  `php artisan key:generate`
- [ ] Install JWT Auth package:  
  `composer require tymon/jwt-auth`
- [ ] Publish JWT config:  
  `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"`
- [ ] Generate JWT secret:  
  `php artisan jwt:secret`
- [ ] Run migrations to set up your tables:  
  `php artisan migrate`
- [ ] (Optional) Seed the database with an initial admin user:  
  `php artisan db:seed`

---

### 4. **Backend Development Workflow**
- [ ] Design your database schema (write or update migrations for: users, assets, locations, statuses, maintenance, etc.).
- [ ] Implement Models, Controllers, and Routes for:
    - Users (with roles)
    - Hardware, Software, and Didactic Equipment
    - Locations
    - Statuses
    - Maintenance logs (polymorphic relation)
    - Asset images/documents (polymorphic relation)
- [ ] Use Eloquent's [polymorphic relationships](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#polymorphic-relationships) for images and maintenance logs.
- [ ] Protect routes using JWT authentication and role middleware.
- [ ] Test all endpoints using Insomnia.
- [ ] Document your API endpoints in `/docs/api.md`.

---

### 5. **Frontend (React) Setup** *(after backend is working)*
- [ ] Go to the `frontend` folder:  
  `cd ../frontend`
- [ ] Install dependencies:  
  `npm install`
- [ ] Set up `.env` for API URL if needed.
- [ ] Start the development server:  
  `npm start`

---

### 6. **Frontend Development Workflow**
- [ ] Build authentication pages (login, session management with JWT).
- [ ] Build pages for CRUD operations:  
    - Users (admin only)
    - Hardware, Software, Didactic Equipment
    - Locations
    - Statuses
    - Maintenance logs
    - Asset images/documents
- [ ] Implement role-based access (hide/show navigation based on user role).
- [ ] Polish UI with your chosen UI library (Material UI, Bootstrap, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure all user flows are tested and functional.

---

### 7. **Documentation**
- [ ] Keep `/docs/api.md` updated with all available endpoints and usage.
- [ ] Add a database schema diagram (ERD) to `/docs/` (see below for guidance).
- [ ] Update this README.md if setup steps change.

---

### 8. **Final Steps**
- [ ] Thoroughly test the application (both backend and frontend).
- [ ] Clean up any test data and code comments.
- [ ] Ensure all documentation is clear and updated.
- [ ] Commit and push all final changes to GitHub.

## User Roles

| Role      | Permissions                                                               |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Admin     | Full access: manage users, assets, locations, statuses, maintenance, view reports   |
| Technician| Manage/view assets, locations, statuses, maintenance. Cannot manage users           |

---

## Database Schema & ER Diagrams

- The full schema and sample data are in [`/docs/database_schema.md`](docs/database_schema.md).
- **ER Diagram Guidance:**  
  - Draw all tables and their columns.
  - Use solid lines for direct foreign keys.
  - Use dashed or colored lines for polymorphic links from `asset_images` and `maintenance_logs` to each asset table, labeled "polymorphic reference".
  - Add a legend or note explaining the polymorphic relationship.
